One thing we expect of poems is that they stand alone: we shouldn’t have to know context or background to understand a poem. Poems should contain their own directions, allow us to assemble and read them on their own terms. But we know that letters are only products of context. They are part of endless chains of other letters and communications, and when we read them we can be comfortable and even delight in our only partial knowledge.

Epistolary poetry also focuses our attention on the audience (the ‘to whom’) of poetry rather than its subjects and meanings (the ‘what’). … Poets who use epistolary address also attempt to figure out not just who that ‘you’ is—whether it’s a close friend or all posterity—but what, and how to meaningfully communicate with them. It’s a question poets have been asking themselves since writing, and letters, appeared.
